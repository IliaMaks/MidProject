## Features

- 📋 Client management (add/view clients)
- 💰 Loan management (add/view loans)
- 📉 Amortization schedule per loan
- 🏦 Bank treasury overview with payment application
- 🔐 Secure with `session`-based state storage for isolation per user
- 🐳 Dockerized application with automated deployment
- 🎨 Styled with Bootstrap for responsive UI
- ☁️ Hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk via ECR and S3

### For local development

- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- `zip` command (required for packaging `Dockerrun.aws.json`)
  - On Windows, install with:
    ```bash
    winget install --id=GnuWin32.Zip
    ```
  - Or manually download and add to `PATH`
- (Optional)  [winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) for installing CLI tools

### For deployment (AWS Academy environment)

- AWS CLI (configured with `aws configure`)\
  Go to "C:\Users\\\\.aws\credentials" and paste the data from \
  AWS academy session's details. {aws\_access\_key\_id, aws\_secret\_access, aws\_session\_token}

   
- AWS services used:
  - ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
  - S3 Bucket (for ZIP file upload)
  - Elastic Beanstalk (Docker solution stack)

## Known Limitations

- Stateless architecture between instances (session used for state)
- No persistent database (in-memory only)
- Meant for educational/demo use, not production
